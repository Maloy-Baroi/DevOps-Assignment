## Key Learnings from this Assignment:

### Git Basics
- `git init`        → Initialize a local repository
- `git add .`       → Stage all changes
- `git commit -m`   → Commit with a message
- `git branch`      → List or create branches
- `git checkout -b` → Create and switch to a new branch
- `git merge`       → Merge a branch into the current one
- `git push`        → Push commits to remote
- `git pull`        → Fetch and merge from remote
- `git clone`       → Copy a remote repo locally

### GitHub Concepts
- **Repository**: Remote storage for your codebase
- **Branch**: Isolated line of development
- **Pull Request (PR)**: Propose changes from one branch to another
- **Merge**: Integrate changes from a PR into the target branch
- **Fork**: Copy of another user's repository under your account

### Deployment (Render)
- Render is a free cloud hosting platform
- Supports Python/Django, Node.js, and more
- Uses `render.yaml` for Infrastructure-as-Code deployment
- Environment variables manage secrets (SECRET_KEY, DEBUG)
- WhiteNoise serves static files without a separate CDN

## Todo App Tech Stack:
- Django 5.x (Python web framework)
- SQLite (development database)
- Gunicorn (production WSGI server)
- WhiteNoise (static file serving)
- Tailwind CSS (UI styling via CDN)
- Render (cloud deployment platform)
